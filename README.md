# DATA ENGINEERING TOOLKIT

This project was created as part of the [Data Engineering Community](https://dataengineeringcommunity.com/) LaunchPad, with the goal of building practical, job-ready skills through hands-on exercises.

This repository is a practical collection of scripts and utilities designed to practice and demonstrate core Data Engineering skills. It follows best practices in version control with the Gitflow branching strategy, incorporates GitHub workflows, and simulates collaboration through pull requests and code reviews.

The toolkit focuses on the fundamental building blocks of a data pipeline:

- Cleaning raw data

- Transforming data into usable formats

- Loading data into storage
